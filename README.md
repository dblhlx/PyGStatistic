BSA-Seq data analysis - Python implementation of the G-statistic method

This is the Python implementation of [the G-statistic method](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002255) for BSA-Seq data analysis. You can issue the command `python PyBSASeq_GTest.py` in a terminal to test the script. It is required to uncompress the [snp_final.tsv.bz2 file](https://github.com/dblhlx/PyBSASeq/blob/master/snp_final.tsv.bz2) to the working directory before testing. Options as in [PyBSASeq](https://github.com/dblhlx/PyBSASeq) are needed to use the script for your own SNP datasets. Please note running the script with the above SNP dataset took more than four weeks to complete on a desktop computer (3.4 GHz Intel Core i7-6700 CPU and 28 GB ram).
